        Welcome to Valshape! A 3D web app designed to help artists study the value of basic forms. Bust out and pen, pencil, tablet, stick, or anything that can make a mark and start shading!
        For now, this app is best used on a large landscape screen, like a laptop or desktop. Each scene is contains a specified amount of shapes at random positions. The lighting position is also random. Use the &quot;REDRAW&quot; button to generate a new scene. 
        You can use the control panel below the scene to customize the number and kind of shapes in the scene. If the camera angle isn&apos;t working for you try the orbit controls under &quot;Advanced Settings&quot;.
        The light controls are useful for scenes where the light may be in a wierd spot or if you specifically want to study dim light scenes.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">About This Project</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        I built this tool mainly for myself and thought others would benefit as well. Studying simple forms like these is a great way to work towards mastery.
        Improving your understanding of light and shadow starts by building a rock solid foundation with basic forms. Use this tool to lay the bricks that your sky scrapper will one day stand on. Or just to stay fresh. <br /> <br />

      <ul>
        <p className='font-bold'>Known issues:</p>
        <li className="mb-2">
          - Mobile view works but is not pretty and shapes may be rendered outside the viewing window.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          - Shapes may render inside eachother (not sure if this is a bug or feature though. I think it&apos;s cool üòé)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <p className='font-bold'>Features in the works:</p>
        <li className="mb-2">
          - Different materials for shapes (metalic, cartoon, etc.)
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          - Procedurally generated 3D blobs to help study more organic forms.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          - More shapes (dodecahedron, pyramid, etc.)
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          - Timed study sessions. Adding a timer and switching scenes automatically.
